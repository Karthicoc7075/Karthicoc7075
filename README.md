### Hey there 👋

I’m Karthi, a MERN Stack Developer 

I build full-stack web applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, focusing on clean architecture, performance, and scalability. I enjoy turning ideas into complete, working products.

This is my personal GitHub profile where I share my projects, experiments, and things I’m currently learning.
All projects here are built from scratch — no copy-paste templates.
